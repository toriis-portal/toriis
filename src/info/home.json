The letter must define divestment in clear and accessible terms. We define divestment as the act of removing investments in companies involved in fossil fuel extraction, refinement, or transportation — including oil, natural gas, and coal. It is imperative that this letter urges the UIF to avoid companies that profit from the extraction, refinement, or transportation of coal, petroleum, or natural gas. Without this explicit terminology that addresses and tackles divestment directly, any statements about investment evaluations are destined to be ignored.",
