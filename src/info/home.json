The letter must define divestment in clear and accessible terms. We define divestment as the act of removing investments in companies involved in fossil fuel extraction, refinement, or transportation — including oil, natural gas, and coal. It is imperative that this letter urges the UIF to avoid companies that profit from the extraction, refinement, or transportation of coal, petroleum, or natural gas. Without this explicit terminology that addresses and tackles divestment directly, any statements about investment evaluations are destined to be ignored.",

The corporate bonds the University of Illinois System holds in fossil fuel companies provide an avenue for fossil fuel companies to raise corporate debt to finance their operations. Ending the purchasing of bonds in this sector will decrease the demand for corporate debt in this sector, which in turn will impact the amount of debt eligible to be raised. In tandem, when the University of Illinois Foundation sells its risk assets in this sector, the market-clearing price will decrease, driving down the market capitalization of the company. Technical economics aside, the purpose of divesting from industry is to remove the social license of that industry. By pulling investments out of the fossil fuel industry, the University of Illinois is taking a stance against the heavy polluters that overly contribute to climate change."

However, there is no explicit policy in place that dictates how the university shall utilize the influence of their shares to impact the fossil fuel industry. Without an explicit policy in place, the university cannot claim to be advocating for shareholders. Furthermore, it has been claimed that by excusing ourselves from the fossil fuel industry, actors with the intent to expand the fossil fuel industry will gain more shares, hence negatively influencing these companies. This argument misses the point of fossil fuel divestment: It is up to the University of Illinois to actively make decisions to fight climate change, and refusing to divest from fossil fuels is a non-active approach."
